# Climate Normals
Climate Normals is a comprehensive view of climate patterns over a 21-year period. Using weather data with an hourly temporal resolution, the climate normals calculates and presents data for the period between 2000 and 2020. The data set offers valuable insights into long-term climate trends and patterns, making it an essential tool for businesses, governments, and individuals looking to understand and plan for the future. With its high-resolution data and long-term perspective, Climate Normals is an innovative and powerful resource for anyone interested in understanding and managing the impacts of climate change.

This repository contains two scripts for processing climate data:
1. data pull
This script is used to pull data for climate normals. The script downloads data from a specified source and processes it into a usable format.
2. output images
This script creates ridge plots of climate data for every month. The input to this script is the processed data generated by the "data pull" script. The output of this script are the ridge plots, which can be used to visualize the climate data.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
  - requests
  - ridgeplot
  - plotly
  - pandas
  - json
  - csv
